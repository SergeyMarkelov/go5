# go5

my first GoLang API was made for practice

Technology: gorilla/mux, sqlite.

Write in the browser http://localhost:8080/health-check. The response must contain a page with the words "API is up and running"

The login function, if you want to check it, you need open browser and use the link: http://localhost:8080/login. 
There are two fields on a given page: "Login" and "Password". 
After entering the data and clicking "send", the user will go to one of the pages with a positive or negative result.
